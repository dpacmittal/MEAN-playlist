To-do:
	Bugs/Improvements:
		Make normalized data structures (playlists, songs, search-results) for cleaner code
		SearchFactory should have methods like next page.
		Add helper methods to gapiFactory for avoiding code-repetition.
		Combine youtube.js and gapi.js into one. We don't need two services to interact with youtube.


	Features:
		Make panels resizable
		Ability to connect to youtube account and fetch playlists directly from there and ability to edit them. Then it saves the changes to youtube.
		Make automatic next page loading on scroll for search results.
